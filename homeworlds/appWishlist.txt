Most of my feature wish-list for online Homeworlds has been listed by others, but here are some things I'd like to see (in rough order of importance)

Correct implementation of the current rules (SDG is a few versions behind)

Real-time play option

Saved game history for future study

Exporting game history as text

Drag-n-drop play interface

Automatic system naming (for each star color, I have a handful of names that I use. Letting users provide such lists ahead of time would be fun)

Warning dialog if you are eliminating yourself

Move confirmation (like a turn token: your turn isn't over until you click "Make this my move")

The ability to explore games from uploaded history files

Black and white piece option (good for people who are colorblind or who want to print positions without color ink)
