<h2>
Choosing your homeworld
</h2>
<h3>
<a name='instafreeze'/>Instafreeze
</h3>
<p>
This is a trap you can set for new players when you move second.
</p>
<p>
If your opponent chooses a small star that is blue or green,
you also choose a small star of that color <i>as well as your first ship</i>.
You can build the last small piece of that color as a ship
and freeze them out of that color (see below).

</p>
<p>
New players won't notice the problem and you can build mediums and larges
of that color before they know what hit them.
</p>
<p>
Experienced players will respond by trading their initial (large) ship
to enter the economy and the position will be about even.
<h3>
Going second
</h3>
If your opponent chose a small star,
you probably shouldn't have a small star of the same color
(unless you're attempting an Instafreeze).
</p>
<p>
They can get the last piece of that color as a ship and freeze you out.
</p>

<h3>
<a name='doomsweek'/>Slow Doomsday Machines
</h3>
<p>
Inevitable doom can take more than a day.
<ul>
    <li> Slow doomsday (doomsweek?) machine<br>
        Like a doomsday machine, but with a pair of medium yellows instead of larges.
        The first or last ship of each color can be moved singly with an ordinary yellow power move.
    <li> Extra slow (doomsmonth?) machine<br>
        No yellow sacrifice at all,
        just move the six catastrophe ships one at a time.
        Importantly, the SECOND ship of each color should be large.
        Your opponent will normally attack the first ship after you move it in.
        Then you move in a large ship, and your opponent would like to reduce the concentration of that color
        by getting rid of the first ship (which they now own).
        But they must respond to the large by attacking it
        (assuming you have sacrificial red ships somewhere to make a large ship a threat).
        The third ship (of any size) can then move in for the catastrophe.<br>
</ul>

South safely destroys both home stars of North via
<center>
<div id='moves'>move g1 S1 North</div>
<div id='moves'>move g3 S2 North</div>
<div id='moves'>move g1 S2 North<br>catastrophe North g</div>
<div id='moves'>move y1 S2 North</div>
<div id='moves'>move y3 S1 North</div>
<div id='moves'>move y1 S2 North<br>catastrophe North y</div>
</center>
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the doomsmonth machine does not usually work on red stars
(<a href='#noSlowRedCat'>see here</a>).
</p>
<h3>
<a name='noSlowRedCat'/>No slow red catastrophe
</h3>
<p>
Your opponent can't usually cause a red catastrophe by moving red ships one at a time.
If they attempt this it,
<ol>
<li> They move a red ship into your system.
<li> You attack the first red ship.
<li> They move another red ship into your system.
<li> You sacrifice the first red ship to attack the second red ship.
<li> They see the error of their ways.
</ol>
For example, in the position below, South has just blundered
by moving r3 into North's home.
North should sacrifice the r1 and attack the invader.
South has regrets.

</p>
You should check your own situation carefully, however.
You must have a ship large enough to attack any invading reds,
and—if you are defending a red system marker—
you shouldn't let your only large ship be red.
You won't be able to sacrifice the r3 to attack an invading r3,
so a slow red catastrophe can happen when your opponent
moves in with their second ship.
