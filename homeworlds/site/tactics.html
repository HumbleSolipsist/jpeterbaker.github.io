<a href="index.html">My main Homeworlds page</a>
</p>
<p>
This page is about what to do in some specific Homeworlds situations.
I also have <a href="strategy.html">a page about strategy</a> at a more general level.
</p>
<h2>
Choosing your homeworld
</h2>
<h3>
Homeworld colors
</h3>
<p>
You should always start with green (either as a home star or starting ship).
Otherwise, you'll never be able to build a ship and you can't win.
Sure you could start with red, yellow, and blue and then trade your ship to a green,
but you may as well have started with a green ship.
</p>
<p>
You should almost certainly start with blue.
Blue at home makes it easier to get ships in a variety of colors,
but you could technically discover a blue system after a couple of moves
and get your color variety from there.
</p>
<p>
Most players pick a large green as their first ship
(hoping to sacrifice it at some point to beat their opponent at getting more large ships).
That means they want one home star to be blue,
so the first color question they face is: should the other star be yellow (what Andy calls the "quick start") or red ("planetary defense system")?
</p>
<p>
I don't think that getting to move a ship out of your home one turn earlier is the real reason to pick a yellow star.
Instead, having a yellow star makes it more difficult to destroy your home by star demolition.
A regular or slow Doomsday machine involving a yellow star requires a big yellow-economy advantage.
Consider what it takes to make a <a href="#doomsweek">slow Doomsday machine</a> against a yellow-blue home:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Three blue ships to trigger a blue star catastrophe
    <li> Three yellow ships to trigger a yellow star catastrophe
    <li> Two medium yellows to sacrifice (or large yellows for a traditional two-turns-to-victory machine)
</ul>
<p>
One yellow piece is the target home star,
so the slow Doomsday machine must have 5 of the other 8 yellow pieces as ships.
Five-of-eight may sound like just a little more than half,
but remember that there are likely to be some other yellow stars around.
If there are even 2 other yellow stars,
the defender only needs 2 yellow ships to make the slow doomsday machine impossible.
</p>
<p>
Extra-slow Doomsday machines require fewer yellow ships, so I consider them to be the threat to my yellow home star.
</p>
<p>
One advantage of having a red star in your home is easy to understand: you can capture a lone invader as long as you have a large ship.
Another advantage is that your red star is almost impervious to extra-slow Doomsday machines
(<a href="#noSlowRedCat">see below</a>).
To me, the biggest advantage of a red home star is that it is not yellow.
By not having a yellow star in your home, it is easier to produce yellow ships in your home,
and I consider yellow the most important economy to keep strong.
</p>
<h3>
Homeworld sizes
</h3>
<p>
The homeworld size options are named <a href="glossary.html#homesize">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The banker setup is named for the investments that you can make
by simply moving a green ship out of your home.
In my games, investment systems usually get invaded before they can be cashed in,
but it does seem like bankers successfully invest the most often.
</p>
<p>
As you read the game rules for the first time, you may think that the Goldilocks home setup offers some of the advantages of the banker and fortress.
I haven't found this to be true.
Except for a strange late-game situation, I've never seen anyone deliberately invest in a medium star,
so I'd say Goldilocks does not provide better investment opportunities than the fortress.
Although the supply of medium pieces may run out,
I don't recall any games where a Goldilocks system was difficult to reach because of a low medium supply.
I think of the name "Goldilocks" referring to the simple fact that the connected stars are medium:
not big and not small (like Baby Bear's chair).
</p>
<p>
To me, the important aspect of Goldilocks systems comes toward the end of the early game when medium ships are starting to come into play.
You can accelerate the economy of your choosing by discovering medium stars of that color
and getting access to large ships more quickly.
</p>
<p>
The strategy guides published by Looney Labs say that the fortress is hard to invade.
I have played a few long games where the lack of small stars played an important role,
but from what I've seen, the fortress has a more important role on the early game.
Fortresses are the only homeworlds that do not have the "small star problem" described later.
Fortresses also make it easy to jump-start an economy of your choosing by discovering small stars of that color.
</p>
<h3>
The small star problem
</h3>
<p>
Any time that you include a small star in your homeworld,
the economy of that star's color gets a little head start:
you've removed a small piece of that color,
so medium ships of that color may be built sooner.
Because of the danger of overpopulation,
it is a little more difficult to participate in the economies
corresponding to your home star colors.
Thus, small stars give a little boost to an economy
where you have a disadvantage
(possibly leading to a ship size advantage for your opponent).
</p>
<p>
In particular, if you are going second
and your opponent chose a small star,
you probably shouldn't have a small star of the same color
(unless you're attempting an <a href="#instafreeze">Instafreeze</a>).
They can get the last small of that color as a ship and freeze you out.
</p>
<h3>
<a name='instafreeze'/>Instafreeze
</h3>
<p>
This is a trap you can set for new players when you move second.
</p>
<p>
If your opponent chooses a small star that is blue or green,
(or maybe even yellow)
you also choose a small star <i>and first ship</i> of that color.
You can build the last small piece of that color as a ship
and freeze them out of that color (see below).
<center>
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/oBOddA5.png'><br>
All of the small blue pieces are in play.
Players usually trade their small ships to get new technologies,
but Alpha will have to trade their large ship to get blue.
</center>
</p>
<p>
New players won't notice the problem and you can build mediums and larges
of that color before they know what hit them.
</p>
<p>
Experienced players will respond by trading their initial (large) ship
to enter the economy and the position will be about even.
<h2>
<a name='doomsweek'>Slow Doomsday machines
</h2>
<p>
Inevitable doom can take more than a day.
<ul>
    <li> A slow Doomsday (Doomsweek?) machine is like a Doomsday machine, but with a pair of medium yellows instead of larges.
        The first or last ship of each color can be moved singly with an ordinary yellow power move.
    <li> An extra slow (Doomsmonth?) machine doesn't require any yellow sacrifice at all.
        You just move the six catastrophe ships one at a time.
        Importantly, the SECOND ship of each color should be large.
        Your opponent will normally attack the first ship after you move it in.
        Then you move in a large ship, and your opponent would like to reduce the concentration of that color
        by getting rid of the first ship (which they now own).
        But they must respond to the large by attacking it
        (assuming you have sacrificial red ships somewhere to make your large ship a threat).
        The third ship (of any size) can then move in for the catastrophe.
</ul>

<p>
In the particular scenario above, Alpha must attack on moves 2 and 5
because otherwise Beta may achieve the catastrophes
by sacrificing g3.
In many scenarios, the defender may simply ignore the small invading ships and use the turn productively.
Sometimes, they may use that turn to launch a counterattack,
either on the Doomsday machine or on the enemy homeworld.
Before you engage your slow Doomsday machine, make sure your opponent can't use the spare time to ruin your plan.
</p>
<p>
Doomsday machines can also be of mixed type.
For example, you can demolish one home star in three turns (extra slow) and then demolish the other star in two turns.
These machines might be usefully labelled as number-color/number-color.
If you have a three turn Doomsday machine targeting blue
and half of a traditional one-turn Doomsday machine targeting red,
you might call it a 3-blue/1-red Doomsday machine.
The order in which the colors are destroyed sometimes matters
(in the example above, the green ships needed the yellows in order to move in,
so it was important that green was demolished first).
The order of the colors in this notation I just made up should match demolition order.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the Doomsmonth machine does not usually work on red stars
(<a href='#noSlowRedCat'>see here</a>).
</p>
<h3>
<a name='noSlowRedCat'/>No slow red catastrophe
</h3>
<p>
Your opponent can't usually cause a red catastrophe against you by moving red ships one at a time.
If they attempt this, here's what should happen
</p>
<ol>
<li> They move a red ship into your system.
<li> You attack the first red ship.
<li> They move another red ship into your system.
<li> You sacrifice the first red ship to attack the second red ship.
<li> They see the error of their ways.
</ol>
<p>
For example, in the position below, Beta has just blundered
by moving r3 into Alpha's home.
Alpha should sacrifice the r1 and attack the invader.
Beta has regrets.
</p>
<center>
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/SfK41v1.png'>
</center>
<p>
You should check your own situation carefully, however.
You must have a ship large enough to attack any invading reds,
and—if you are defending a red system marker—
you shouldn't let your only large ship be a red one.
If your only large ship is red as well as a system marker,
then you won't be able to sacrifice the r3 to attack an invading r3,
so a slow red catastrophe can happen when your opponent
moves in with their second red ship.
</p>

<h2>
<a name='invasion'>Textbook direct assault
</h2>
<p>
Of the three <a href="glossary.html#paths">paths to victory</a>,
the direct assault seems to get the least attention.
Every strategy guide talks about
Doomsday machines (the surest way to achieve star demolition)
and the Bluebird mistake (allowing a game-losing fleet catastrophe).
New players may not have a clear idea of how a direct assault occurs,
so their first exposure is likely to be a defeat they didn't see coming.
</p>
<p>
Typically, every player has a large ship in their homeworld and a red ship someplace (which they could sacrifice).
If your opponent doesn't have a red ship,
they'll probably at least have a <a href="glossary.html#planetaryDefense">planetary defense system</a>.
So if you move any ship into your opponent's home, they'll just capture it, right?
</p>
<p>
Not if you invade with several ships at once so that they can't all be captured.
Your opponent's defenses will determine the size of the invasion fleet you need.
Say the number of large ships in your opponent's home is L,
and their largest red ship is of size N
(a planetary defense system counts as a small red ship, N=1).
If N+L is more than 3, then a basic direct assault won't work.
You could theoretically have a two-wave invasion with more than three ships,
but that's more complicated than I'm going to illustrate here.
If they have no access to red, N=0.
</p>
<p>
Here's what you need:
</p>
<ul>
<li> N+1 large ships poised to move into your opponent's home.
<li> A yellow ship of size N+L.
<li> A red ship of size N+L.
</ul>
<p>
Here's the battle plan:
</p>
<ul>
<li> You sacrifice your yellow ship and move your N+1 large ships into your opponent's home
<li> They sacrifice their largest red to attack N of your invading larges (you still have one left)
<li> You sacrifice your red ship to attack the N ships that they just captured
as well as the L large ships that they had to begin with.
</ul>
<p>
You now have two or more large ships in your opponent's home and they have none.
Usually, their only defense at this point (besides a counterattack)
is to catastrophe your larges.
</p>
<p>
Compared to catastrophe-based wins, direct assaults can be difficult to plan.
When all you want to do is create catastrophes, it's usually easy to see if it will work out.
When you're invading and capturing ships, you need your ships to stay alive,
and your opponent may have time to fight back.
It can get confusing.
You need to examine your own case carefully to figure out how to invade.
