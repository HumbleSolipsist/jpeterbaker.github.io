<a href="index.html">My main Homeworlds page</a>
</p>
<p>
This page is about what to do in some specific Homeworlds situations.
I also have <a href="strategyGuide.html">a page about strategy</a> at a more general level.
</p>
<h2>
Choosing your homeworld
</h2>
<h3>
Homeworld colors
</h3>
<p>
You should always start with green (either as a home star or starting ship).
Otherwise, you'll never be able to build a ship and you can't win.
Sure you could start with red, yellow, and blue and then trade your ship to a green,
but you may as well have started with a green ship.
</p>
<p>
You should almost certainly start with blue.
Blue at home makes it easier to get ships in a variety of colors,
but you could technically discover a blue system after a couple of moves
and get your color variety from there.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
The small star problem
</h3>
<p>
Any time that you include a small star in your homeworld,
the economy of that star's color gets a little head start:
you've removed a small piece of that color,
so medium ships of that color may be built sooner.
Because of the danger of overpopulation,
it is a little more difficult to participate in the economies
corresponding to your home star colors.
Thus, small stars give a little boost to an economy
where you have a disadvantage
(possibly leading to a ship size advantage for your opponent).
</p>
<p>
In particular, if you are going second
and your opponent chose a small star,
you probably shouldn't have a small star of the same color
(unless you're attempting an <a href="#instafreeze">Instafreeze</a>).
They can get the last small of that color as a ship and freeze you out.
</p>
<h3>
<a name='instafreeze'/>Instafreeze
</h3>
<p>
This is a trap you can set for new players when you move second.
</p>
<p>
If your opponent chooses a small star that is blue or green,
(or maybe even yellow)
you also choose a small star <i>and first ship</i> of that color.
You can build the last small piece of that color as a ship
and freeze them out of that color (see below).
<center>
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/oBOddA5.png'><br>
All of the small blue pieces are in play.
Players usually trade their small ships to get new technologies,
but Alpha will have to trade their large ship to get blue.
</center>
</p>
<p>
New players won't notice the problem and you can build mediums and larges
of that color before they know what hit them.
</p>
<p>
Experienced players will respond by trading their initial (large) ship
to enter the economy and the position will be about even.
<h2>
<a name='doomsweek'>Slow Doomsday machines
</h2>
<p>
Inevitable doom can take more than a day.
<ul>
    <li> A slow Doomsday (Doomsweek?) machine is like a Doomsday machine, but with a pair of medium yellows instead of larges.
        The first or last ship of each color can be moved singly with an ordinary yellow power move.
    <li> An extra slow (Doomsmonth?) machine doesn't require any yellow sacrifice at all.
        You just move the six catastrophe ships one at a time.
        Importantly, the SECOND ship of each color should be large.
        Your opponent will normally attack the first ship after you move it in.
        Then you move in a large ship, and your opponent would like to reduce the concentration of that color
        by getting rid of the first ship (which they now own).
        But they must respond to the large by attacking it
        (assuming you have sacrificial red ships somewhere to make your large ship a threat).
        The third ship (of any size) can then move in for the catastrophe.
</ul>

In the particular scenario above, Alpha must attack on moves 2 and 5
because otherwise Beta may achieve the catastrophes
by sacrificing g3.
In many scenarios, the defender may simply ignore the small invading ships and use the turn productively.
Sometimes, they may use that turn to launch a counterattack,
either on the Doomsday machine or on the enemy homeworld.
Before you engage your slow Doomsday machine, make sure your opponent can't use the spare time to ruin your plan.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the Doomsmonth machine does not usually work on red stars
(<a href='#noSlowRedCat'>see here</a>).
</p>
<h3>
<a name='noSlowRedCat'/>No slow red catastrophe
</h3>
<p>
Your opponent can't usually cause a red catastrophe by moving red ships one at a time.
If they attempt this it,
</p>
<ol>
<li> They move a red ship into your system.
<li> You attack the first red ship.
<li> They move another red ship into your system.
<li> You sacrifice the first red ship to attack the second red ship.
<li> They see the error of their ways.
</ol>
<p>
For example, in the position below, Beta has just blundered
by moving r3 into Alpha's home.
Alpha should sacrifice the r1 and attack the invader.
Beta has regrets.
</p>
<center>
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/SfK41v1.png'>
</center>
<p>
You should check your own situation carefully, however.
You must have a ship large enough to attack any invading reds,
and—if you are defending a red system marker—
you shouldn't let your only large ship be a red one.
If your only large ship is red as well as a system marker,
then you won't be able to sacrifice the r3 to attack an invading r3,
so a slow red catastrophe can happen when your opponent
moves in with their second red ship.
</p>

<h2>
<a name='invasion'>Textbook direct assault
</h2>
<p>
Of the three <a href="glossary.html#paths">paths to victory</a>,
the direct assault seems to get the least attention.
Every strategy guide talks about
Doomsday machines (the surest way to achieve star demolition)
and the Blurbird mistake (allowing a game-losing fleet catastrophe).
New players may not have a clear idea of how a direct assault occurs,
so their first exposure is likely to be a defeat they didn't see coming.
</p>
<p>
Typically, every player has a large ship in their homeworld and a red ship someplace (which they could sacrifice).
If your opponent doesn't have a red ship,
they'll probably at least have a <a href="glossary.html#planetaryDefense">planetary defense system</a>.
So if you move any ship into your opponent's home, they'll just capture it, right?
</p>
<p>
Not if you invade with several ships at once so that they can't all be captured.
Your opponent's defenses will determine the size of the invasion fleet you need.
Say the number of large ships in your opponent's home is L,
and their largest red ship is of size N
(a planetary defense system counts as a small red ship, N=1).
If N+L is more than 3, then a basic direct assault won't work.
You could theoretically have a two-wave invasion with more than three ships,
but that's more complicated than I'm going to illustrate here.
If they have no access to red, N=0.
</p>
<p>
Here's what you need:
</p>
<ul>
<li> N+1 large ships poised to move into your opponent's home.
<li> A yellow ship of size N+L.
<li> A red ship of size N+L.
</ul>
<p>
Here's the battle plan:
</p>
<ul>
<li> You sacrifice your yellow ship and move your N+1 large ships into your opponent's home
<li> They sacrifice their largest red to attack N of your invading larges (you still have one left)
<li> You sacrifice your red ship to attack the N ships that they just captured
as well as the L large ships that they had to begin with.
</ul>
<p>
You now have two or more large ships in your opponent's home and they have none.
Usually, their only defense at this point (besides a counterattack)
is to catastrophe your larges.
</p>
<p>
Compared to catastrophe-based wins, direct assaults can be difficult to plan.
When all you want to do is create catastrophes, it's usually easy to see if it will work out.
When you're invading and capturing ships, you need your ships to stay alive,
and your opponent may have time to fight back.
It can get confusing.
You need to examine your own case carefully to figure out how to invade.
