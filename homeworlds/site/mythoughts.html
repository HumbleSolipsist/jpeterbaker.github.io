<p>
The rules of Homeworlds don't say why systems are connected in the way that they are.
That's good enough for some people, but to me, the rules cry out for a physical explanation.
There should be possible to imagine something involving large distances or obstructions
that would cause locations to be "connected"
in the tripartite pattern of Homeworlds systems.
</p>
<p>
My best explanation is illustrated below.
The connection rules of Homeworlds could be the result of
three linear travel-preventing regions arranged in a triangle.
The "sizes" of stars could refer to which side of the triangle they lie in.
Homeworlds, with two stars, lie at the corners where
travel is impossible from two sides of the triangle.
