Felix vs dlwillson
<br>
This game was part of the
<a href='../../tournament/links2021winter.html'>HWL Winter League 2021</a>.
There was a service interruption on the HWL website, so the players couldn't finish.
One player kept partial records of the game until the interruption,
and this record is the best reconstruction I could manage.

After the service interruption,
the game was continued in analog.
dlwillson went on to win,
but there is no record of the rest of the game.
