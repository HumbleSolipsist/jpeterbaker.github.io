<div style='width:1000px'>

<p style='margin:5px'>
Gather three pyramids in each of three sizes and four colors
(red, yellow, green, and blue).
All 36 pieces start out of play in a shared bank.
</p>
<p style='margin:5px'>
Standing pieces are stars that mark star systems.
Pieces lying down are ships.
You control ships pointing away from you.
</p>

<div style='width:50%;display:inline-block;float:left'>

<h3>
On your turn
</h3>

<p style='margin:5px'>
<b>First turn</b>: choose any three pieces and arrange them as stars and a ship for your homeworld.
</p>
<p style='margin:5px'>
<b>Other turns</b>: choose one option below.
</p>

<ol>
    <li> <b>Basic action</b>:
    Chose one of your ships and empower it with the technology (color)
    of a star or any one of your ships in that system.
    <li> <b>Sacrifice</b>:
    Choose one of your ships and return it to the bank.
    Then choose one or more of your ships and empower them
    with the technology of the sacrificed ship.
    The number of other ships you can empower
    is the number of pips on the sacrificed ship.
    <li> <b>Pass</b>: Take no action.
</ol>

<p style='margin:5px'>
<b>Catastrophe</b>:
If four or more pieces of the same color are in the same system,
you may return them to the bank as a free turn action.
</p>

<p style='margin:5px'>
<b>Forgetting</b>:
If a system's last star is destroyed in a catastrophe,
all remaining ships are immediately returned to the bank.
If a system <i>other than a homeworld</i> has no ships,
its star is immediately returned to the bank.
</p>

<h3>
Technologies
</h3>

<ul>
    <li> <b>Red=Capture</b>.
    Take control of an enemy ship in the same system
    that is the same size or smaller than your empowered ship.
    <li> <b>Yellow=Move</b>.
    Move the empowered ship to a connected system,
    that is, one with no star sizes that match the ship's current system.
    Alternatively, take any connected star from the bank
    and have your ship discover it as a new system.
    <li> <b>Green=Build</b>.
    Take the smallest bank piece in the empowered ship's color
    and add it as a ship to the empowered ship's system.
    <li> <b>Blue=Trade</b>.
    Exchange the empowered ship with any piece of the same size from the bank.
</ul>

<h3>
Winning
</h3>
<p style='margin:5px'>
You win if your opponent controls no ships in their homeworld
at the end of a player's turn.
If both players lose homeworld control on the same turn,
the game is a draw.
