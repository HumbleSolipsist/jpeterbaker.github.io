    Setup
    </h3>

    <p style='margin:5px'>
    Gather three pyramids in each of three sizes and four colors
    (red, yellow, green, and blue).
    All 36 pieces start in a shared bank, outside of play.
    </p>
    <p style='margin:5px'>
    Once in play, standing pieces are stars that mark star systems.
    Pieces lying down are ships.
    Your ships point away from you.
    </p>

    <h3 style='margin:10px'>
    Winning
    </h3>

    <p style='margin:5px'>
    You win if your opponent controls no ships in their homeworld
    at the end of either player's turn.
    If both players lose homeworld control on the same turn,
    the game is a draw.
    </p>

    <h3 style='margin:10px'>
    Turn actions
    </h3>

    <p style='margin:5px'>
    The two players alternate taking turns.
    </p>

    <p style='margin:5px'>
    <b>On your first turn</b>,
    choose any three pieces from the bank and orient them
    as two stars and one ship in the same system.
    This is your homeworld system.
    </p>

    <p style='margin:5px'>
    <b>On all other turns</b>,
    do one of the following:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li> <b>Basic action</b>:
        Chose one of your ships and empower it with the technology (color)
        of a star in that system or of any one of your ships in that system.
        <li> <b>Sacrifice</b>:
        Choose one of your ships and return it to the bank.
        Then empower some of your other ships
        with the technology of the sacrificed ship.
        The maximum number of ships you can empower this way
        depends on the sacrificed ship's size:
        small=1, medium=2, large=3.
        <li> <b>Pass</b>: Take no action.
    </ol>

    <h3 style='margin:10px'>
    Technologies
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li> <b>Red=Capture</b>.
        Take control of an enemy ship in the same system
        that is <i>no larger </i>than your empowered ship.
        <li> <b>Yellow=Move</b>.
        Move the empowered ship to a system connected to its current system.
        (Two systems are connected if they do <i>not</i> have any star sizes in common.)
        Alternatively, move your empowered ship to a new system,
        using any connected piece from the bank as a star.
        <li> <b>Green=Build</b>.
        Take the smallest bank piece in the empowered ship's color
        and place it as a ship of yours in the empowered ship's system.
        <li> <b>Blue=Trade</b>.
        Exchange the empowered ship with any piece of the same size from the bank.
    </ul>

    <h3 style='margin:10px'>
    Special events
    </h3>

    <p style='margin:5px'>
    <b>Forgetting</b>:
    If a system <i>other than a homeworld</i> has no ships,
    its star is immediately returned to the bank.
    </p>

    <p style='margin:5px'>
    <b>Catastrophe</b>:
    If four or more pieces of the same color are in the same system,
    you may return them to the bank at any point during your turn
    in addition to your usual turn actions.
    </p>

    <p style='margin:5px'>
    <b>Super nova</b>:
    If a system's last star is destroyed in a catastrophe,
    all remaining ships in that system are immediately returned to the bank.
    </p>
