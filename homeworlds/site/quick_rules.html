<p style='margin:5px'>
Gather three pyramids in each of three sizes and four colors
(red, yellow, green, and blue).
All 36 pieces start in a shared bank, outside of play.
</p>
<p style='margin:5px'>
Once in play, standing pieces are stars that mark star systems.
Pieces lying down are ships.
Your ships point away from you.
</p>

<div style='width:500px;display:inline-block;float:left'>

<h3>
On your turn
</h3>

<p style='margin:5px'>
<b>First turn</b>: choose any three pieces from the bank and orient them
as two stars and one ship in the same system.
This is your homeworld system.
</p>
<p style='margin:5px'>
<b>Other turns</b>: choose one option below.
</p>

<ol>
    <li> <b>Basic action</b>:
    Chose one of your ships and empower it with the technology (color)
    of a star or any one of your ships in that system.
    <li> <b>Sacrifice</b>:
    Choose one of your ships and return it to the bank.
    Then empower some of your other ships
    with the technology of the sacrificed ship.
    The maximum number of ships you can empower this way
    depends on the sacrificed ship's size:
    small=1, medium=2, large=3.
    <li> <b>Pass</b>: Take no action.
</ol>

<p style='margin:5px'>
<b>Catastrophe</b>:
If four or more pieces of the same color are in the same system,
you may return them to the bank as a free turn action.
</p>

<p style='margin:5px'>
<b>Forgetting</b>:
If a system's last star is destroyed in a catastrophe,
all remaining ships are immediately returned to the bank.
If a system <i>other than a homeworld</i> has no ships,
its star is immediately returned to the bank.
</p>

<h3>
Technologies
</h3>

<ul>
    <li> <b>Red=Capture</b>.
    Take control of an enemy ship in the same system
    that is the same size or smaller than your empowered ship.
    <li> <b>Yellow=Move</b>.
    Move the empowered ship to a system connected to its current system.
    (Two systems are connected if they don't have any star sizes in common.)
    Alternatively, move your empowered ship to a new system,
    using any connected piece from the bank as a star.
    <li> <b>Green=Build</b>.
    Take the smallest bank piece in the empowered ship's color
    and add it as a ship to the empowered ship's system.
    <li> <b>Blue=Trade</b>.
    Exchange the empowered ship with any piece of the same size from the bank.
</ul>

<h3>
Winning
</h3>
<p style='margin:5px'>
You win if your opponent controls no ships in their homeworld
at the end of either player's turn.
If both players lose homeworld control on the same turn,
the game is a draw.
