<p>
<a href="index.html">My main Homeworlds page</a>
</p>
<p>
This page is about Homeworlds strategy at a very general level.
I also have <a href="tactics.html">a page about tactics</a>
that discusses more specific scenarios and what to do in them.
</p>

<h2>
The most important questions
</h2>

<ul>
<li>"If I did nothing this turn, what would my opponent's best move be?"
<li>"If I make this move that I am considering, what will my opponent's best move be?"
</ul>

<h2>
Keep an eye on your opponent
</h2>
<p>
Homeworlds is a game where it's easy to charge ahead with your own plans
while ignoring what your opponent is up to until it's too late.
That's why most of the tips above focus on making sure you
look at what your opponent is working on.
Choosing a goal and taking little steps toward it is often easy.
Figuring out your opponent's plan takes work.
</p>
<p>
Before you start thinking about what you want to do next,
identify what objective(s) your opponent was trying to accomplish with their previous turn.
<ul>
<li> Was it a "victory?" Did they just get what they wanted?
<li> Or was it a "setup?" Is it just one step toward something that they want?
    <ul>
    <li> If it is a setup, can you spoil it?
    <li> Or can you get a head start on reacting to their plan's success?
    <li> Or is it safe to work on a plan of your own while they build toward their goal?
    </ul>
<li> Or was it a retreat? Were they just reacting to your last move?
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Moves can be multi-purpose.
Even after you see one purpose to your opponent's move,
check for others.
</p>

<h2>
Keep an eye on the bank
</h2>
<p>
Every strategy guide will warn you about building the last medium or small piece.
</p>
<ul>
<li> If you build the last small, your opponent will probably get to build a medium.
<li> If you build the last medium, your opponent will probably get to build a large.
</ul>
<p>
That's probably a bad thing <u>if you won't be able to build that larger size as well</u>.
But some new players are much too afraid of taking the "last serving."
Look ahead another turn or two.
Figure out what would happen if you and your opponent both kept trying to build that same color.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Who would run out of room first (due to overpopulation)?
<li>Who would end up with the better ships?
</ul>
<p>
It's not only building that can open up choices for your opponent.
Here are all of the ways that you might be handing your opponent an opportunity to build.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you building the last medium or small piece from the bank?
<li>Are you discovering a star that is the last piece of its size?
<li>If your opponent has a medium or large green, can they sacrifice it to skip past a size in the bank?
(see the <a href='glossary.html#chameleonFactory'>Chameleon Factory</a> move).
<li>Are you abandoning a system? Will they want the marker as a ship?
<li>Are you trading a ship? Will they build the old piece?
<li>Are you sacrificing a ship? Will they want to build it?
<li>Are you causing a catastrophe? Will they want to build the pieces?
</ul>

<h2>
<a name='checklist'/>Specific things that are tiresome to constantly consider but neglect will cost you games
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Look at the bank. Is your opponent about to build a big ship? (See previous section)
    <li>Identify <u>every</u> catastrophe your opponent could possibly cause.
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow sacrifices provide extreme mobility. Check twice.
    </ul>
    <li>What if your opponent attempted an all-in homeworld attack right now?
    <ul>
        <li>If they were to start moving all their ships into your home as quickly as possible, what would happen?
        <li>Could you attack the ships as quickly as they arrived?
        <li>Could there be a catastrophe that you wouldn't have time to prevent?
        <li>If their attack would just barely fail, what more do they need to make it succeed?
    </ul>
    <li>What if YOU were to attempt an all-in homeworld attack right now?
    <ul>
        <li>What more do you need to make it succeed?
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name='firstMost'/>Get there first with the most
</h2>
<p>
The American Confederate general Nathan Forrest is credited with summarizing military strategy as,
"Get there first with the most."
This is a useful principle in Homeworlds.
If you already control a system, then you got there first.
If your opponent initiates a 
<a "href=glossary.html#directAssault">direct assault</a> on that system,
you will get the first opportunity to capture ships.
To successfully counteract that first-capture advantage,
your opponent will need to bring more resources to bear than you can
(a bigger ship or yellow and red sacrifices).
If you were there first and you also have "the most,"
then your system is impervious to direct assault.
</p>
<p>
So you just need to watch out for catastrophes...
</p>

<h2>
<a name='deterrent'/>A red anywhere is a red everywhere
</h2>
<p>
One of the strategic tips in any Homeworlds strategy guide is,
"When your opponent gets red, get red yourself."
This is good advice.
It often doesn't even matter much where the red ships are.
If your opponent has a red ship anywhere,
you need to get one anywhere that you can.
Otherwise, your opponent can move any ship to a system where you have ships
and you won't be able to capture it (unless the star is red).
Your opponent will then be able to capture your ship(s) by sacrificing their red ship.
</p>
<p>
A single red ship can simultaneously deter invasions at all of your systems.
Regardless of which system your opponent chooses to invade,
you can sacrifice the red ship and capture the invading ship.
Consequently, your opponent may choose not to attempt any invasions.
I call this the "deterrent principle."
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if your opponent lacks red, your red ship can be used to power an invasion
of <u>any</u> of their systems.
</p>

<h4>
...but a red ship can only be sacrificed once
</h4>
<p>
A single red ship can deter attacks for quite a while,
but remember that a single red ship can only be sacrificed once.
If your opponent launches an invasion that forces you to sacrifice your only red ship,
then you don't have a red ship anymore.
You may now be vulnerable to a second invasion
where your opponent has red ships to sacrifice but you do not.
If that invasion is at your homeworld, you're likely to lose the game.
</p>

<h2>
<a name='alwaysCat'/>Should I call catastrophe?
</h2>
<p>
The short answer is yes.
If there's an overpopulation on the board at the <u>end</u> of your turn,
it's usually because you deliberately created the overpopulation
so that you could cause the catastrophe.
Very rarely, you may be tempted to not call catastrophe when you
cause an overpopulation as a side effect of some other action.
But I'm here to tell you that you should probably trigger that catastrophe anyway.
A good explanation turns out to be pretty long,
so I've made a separate page for it
<a href='always_catastrophe.html'>here</a>.
</p>
<h2>
<a name='materialAdvantage'/>Material advantage
</h2>
<p>
If you have a material advantage, you should be willing to cause catastrophes or
force mutual sacrifices that trim down both fleets by similar amounts.
A one-ship advantage is a bigger deal when both fleets are small than
when they are large.
</p>
<p>
Contrariwise, when you have a material disadvantage, you should build ships and
not worry too much if your opponent builds the same amount.
A one-ship disadvantage shrinks (proportionately) if both fleets grow at
the same rate.
</p>
<p>
If you have more large ships than your opponent, try to harass colonies
before they have time to get another large ship.
Move that big ship into an enemy system with lots of smaller ships and no big ship defending.
Attack any ships that don't manage to escape.
Be careful of catastrophes, which are often the best defense against larger ships.
</p>
<p>
If you have a large-ship disadvantage, spread your fleet out.
A lone ship that can run away is an unattractive target for an invading large.
Ideally, every ship should be be either
<ul>
<li> In a system with a large defender
<li> Or in a system with no other ships, but with an escape plan
(the ship or star is yellow).
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
<a name='redFlags'/>Red flags
</h2>

<p>
Here are BAD situations, roughly in order from worst to least-worst.
I need to avoid these things (unless I can make something even worse happen to my opponent).
Contrariwise, it's good if my opponent has one of these problems.
<ol>
<li>I have no ships in my home and I lose the game.
<li>My opponent has more (or bigger) ships in my home system than I can capture in one turn,
even by sacrificing my largest red.
<li>One of my home system markers is destroyed.
<li>I don't have a large ship in my home system.
<li>There is a near-catastrophe (three pieces) involving my ships
(or the marker for a system where I have ships).
<li>My opponent has a red ship (<a href="#deterrent">anywhere</a>) and I do not.
<li>My opponent has more large ships than me.
<li>My opponent has more yellow ships than me.
<li>My opponent has a ship in the same system as me and it's bigger than my ships there.
<li>The ship(s) in my home system are all the same color
(the <a href='glossary.html#bluebird'/>Bluebird</a> mistake).
<li>My only large ship in my home system is the same color as one (or more!) ships or markers in my home
(my opponent might get a <a href='glossary.html#demolitionFleet'>Demolition Fleet</a>).
</ol>
</p>

<h2>
<a name='swiftVictory'/>Plan for complete, swift victory
</h2>
<p>
As the Homeworlds rules say,
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.looneylabs.com/sites/default/files/literature/Homeworlds%20Rules13.pdf">
"One of the easiest ways to lose this game is<br>
to mount an attack that fails to annihilate your<br>
opponent, but leaves your own empire vulnerable.<br>
This most often happens when you knock out half<br>
of a player's Homeworld, leaving you with fewer<br>
ships and your opponent with a better-connected<br>
Homeworld than before. Plan for total victory!"
</blockquote>
<p>
This is good advice, and I'd like to add some details.
The act of destroying one of your opponent's homestars has three destabilizing effects on the game,
each of which can open new opportunities for your opponent to suddenly ruin your plan.
</p>
<h4>
1. You lost ships
</h4>
<p>
Destroying one of your opponent's stars usually costs you at least three ships.
A two turn demolition can be achieved with three small star-colored ships and a y2--if
you're lucky enough to have all three small ships of the star's color.
Otherwise, you'll be destroying two or more of your own mediums and/or at least one large
(more on what ship size combinations can be used to destroy stars <a href="tactics.html#doomsweek">here</a>).
In many games, that much ship destruction is enough to turn the balance of material power in your opponent's favor.
</p>

<h4>
2. Your opponent's homeworld gained connections
</h4>
<p>
After a star's destruction, your opponent's home is connected to systems with stars of the destroyed star's size
(the <a href="glossary.html#hyperspaceBypass">hyperspace bypass</a> principle).
If that star was a size that is in your own home,
your homes are now connected (assuming that the universe was originally large).
Having connected homes may give your opponent a chance to counter-attack.
</p>

<h4>
3. The bank is refreshed
</h4>
<p>
The bank now has the pieces involved in your catastrophe,
the stars of any systems that you abandoned,
and your sacrificed ship (if you used one).
Your opponent may be able to trade or build the pieces that you just returned.
If you were barely containing your opponent's advances before,
then the new ships might be just what they need to get back in the game.
This is especially true if your move returned a y3 piece to the bank.
A new y3 ship might give your opponent the mobility they need to give you trouble.
</p>

<h4>
...so minimize the come-back risk
</h4>
<p>
Destroying a homestar can throw a game into chaos in the ways listed above,
and you should minimize the length of the chaotic period by
destroying the second star as quickly as possible.
If your plan to demolish the second star requires you to build more ships
or to move ships to different systems,
try to perform these preparation moves <u>before</u> destroying the first star.
