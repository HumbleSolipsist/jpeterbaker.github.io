Babamots' Homeworlds Site

<p>
This is a fan site for the board game
<a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds">
Homeworlds
</a>.
In particular, it's is about <i>Binary</i> Homeworlds,
the two player version.
</p>
<p>
My site is intended for people with a basic understanding of Homeworlds.
If that's not you, you may want to look at the rules or tutorial videos listed on
<a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/content/homeworlds">Looney Labs' Homeworlds index page</a>.

<li> <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=homeworlds">My implementation on Board Game Arena</a>
(this is probably the best place to play online these days)
    <ul>
        <li> Unfortunately, BGA doesn't let you rewind smoothly when reviewing games.
        The best place to review a game visually is the Homeworlds Live sandbox.
        <li> <a href='tools/process_record.html'>
        You can use this neat tool I made</a>
        to convert BGA's game log to HWL format.

While I am serious about Homeworlds, I am not very serious about web design.
Sorry about the style.
