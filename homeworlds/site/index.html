Babamots' Homeworlds Site
</h1>

<p>
This is a fan site for the board game
<a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds">
Homeworlds
</a>.
In particular, it's is about <i>Binary</i> Homeworlds,
the two player version.
</p>
<p>
My site is intended for people with a basic understanding of Homeworlds.
If that's not you,
you may want to look at the rules or tutorial videos listed on
<a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/content/homeworlds">Looney Labs' Homeworlds index page</a>.

While I am serious about Homeworlds, I am not very serious about web design.
Sorry about the style.
