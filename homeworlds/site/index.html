<p>
This is a fan site for the board game
<a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds">
Homeworlds
</a>.
In particular, it's is about <i>Binary</i> Homeworlds,
the two player version.

<p>
If you've never heard of Homeworlds,
you may want to learn the rules or watch videos from
a page on <a href="otherPages.html">this list of other Homeworlds pages</a>.

While I am serious about Homeworlds, I am not very serious about web design.
Sorry about the style.
