Talk about colonies under strategy:
    In a large universe game, you generally only need one near colony but two far colonies (for stockpiling your Doomsday machine parts)

Puzzle
Something involving a blue sacrifice, since those are rare.
    How about, your opponent has just moved some ships into your home. You don't have a large red,
    but you could sacrifice a b2 to turn two of your home larges red. They could attack those, but then you can cat them,
    and they'd be spending their only red to do so leaving them helpless and you with the advantage.

Puzzle
A Doomsday machine where the phases are necessarily intermingled
    For example, you move in two larges of the star colors to start with
    you then cat whichever one they capture
    then you cat the other one
    The hard part will be making it so no other move order would work

More puzzles involving gaining a material advantage rather than just winning.
Also, more puzzles where the solution is not a sacrifice, catastrophe, or home invasion.

Puzzle
    You invade a colony where your large ship can be attacked, but only if your opponent sacrifices their only red ship (an r2). If they were to defend that way, you could launch a direct assault on their home, so they have to retreat or lose ships instead.
