Puzzle
such as something involving a blue sacrifice, since those are rare.
    How about, your opponent has just moved some ships into your home. You don't have a large red,
    but you could sacrifice a b2 to turn two of your home larges red. They could attack those, but then you can cat them,
    and they'd be spending their only red to do so leaving them helpless and you with the advantage.

Puzzle
A Doomsday machine where the phases are necessarily intermingled
For example, you move in two larges of the star colors to start with
you then cat whichever one they capture
then you cat the other one
The hard part will be making it so no other move order would work

Puzzle
Easy ones for the beginners (marked visibly so someone can just go through the introductory ones)
    Need to trade for a red right away

On "thoughts" page
'Righteous' game mode should be the opposite of sinister: eliminate the player on your right
    This makes more sense to me for two reasons:
    1) "Sinister" comes from a word also meaning "left"
        The player who is "sinister" (on your left) should be the one trying to kill you
    2) This gives you the turn just before your would-be killer,
       and thus you have last-minute chance to defend yourself without other players having a chance to interfere before your killer moves.
