On "thoughts" page
'Righteous' game mode should be the opposite of sinister: eliminate the player on your right
    This makes more sense to me for two reasons:
    1) "Sinister" comes from a word also meaning "left"
        The player who is "sinister" (on your left) should be the one trying to kill you
    2) This gives you the turn just before your would-be killer,
       and thus you have last-minute chance to defend yourself without other players having a chance to interfere before your killer moves.
