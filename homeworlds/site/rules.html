</p>

<p>
The rules below are meant to be functionally the same as the official rules,
but I wrote them essentially from scratch in the way that makes the most sense to me.
</p>
<p>
The latest official rules are in
<a href='https://www.looneylabs.com/sites/default/files/literature/Homeworlds%20Rules13.pdf'>
this Pyramid Quartet booklet</a>.

<h2>
Overview
</h2>
<center>
<p style='margin:5px'>
Homeworlds is an epic space opera in the form of a chess-like game
played with colorful pyramid pieces.
</p>
<p style='margin:5px'>
You are a galactic overlord, building and maneuvering an interstellar space fleet.
</p>
<p style='margin:5px'>
The enemy has vowed to exterminate your civilization,
and you have no choice but to destroy them first.
</p>
<p style='margin:5px'>
Capital starships are sacrificed, solar systems are vaporized, and lives are expendable.
</p>
<p style='margin:5px'>
Whatever it takes to defend your Homeworld.

<h3>
The meaning of pieces
</h3>

<p>
The position, orientation, color, and size of each piece have meaning.
</p>
-->

<h3>
How pieces make the starmap
</h3>

<p>
Players share a single supply of pieces.
Out-of-play pieces make up the "bank,"
and in-play pieces are ships and stars.
In-play pieces will be placed into clusters called "star systems."
It doesn't technically matter where you place the star systems,
but the pieces within each star system should be near each other on the surface
so you know they are in the same system.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Standing pieces are stars.
    Most systems only have one star,
    but homeworld systems start the game with two stars.
    <li> Pieces that are lying down are ships.
    Every ship is controlled by one of the players
    and faces the same direction as the controlling player.
    In other words, your ships point away from you.
</ul>
<p>
Every star system must have have at least one star <i>and</i> one ship.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> <b>Ships can't survive without a star</b>.
    If the only star of a system is destroyed,
    all remaining ships are immediately returned to the bank.
    <li> <b>Stars can't survive without a ship</b>.
    Systems without ships are forgotten and removed from the map.
    If the last ship in a system is moved away or destroyed,
    the stars of that system are immediately returned to the bank
    <i>unless the system is a homeworld</i>.
    Homeworld systems aren't forgotten so easily,
    and the stars of a homeworld remain in place even if the system is abandoned.
    This means you can temporarily abandon your homeworld
    and then get a ship back to your homeworld
    by the end of your turn to avoid losing.
</ul>

<!--
<h4>
Color and size
</h4>

<p>
Each piece color represents a technology.
Color represents technology in both ships and stars.
How ships use technologies is explained later.
</p>

<p>
The size of a ship indicates how powerful it is.
Larger ships are better for capturing enemy ships
and provide more sacrifice actions.
</p>

<p>
The size of a star determines how its system is connected to other systems.
This is explained in the yellow technology section.
</p>
-->

<h3>
Winning
</h3>

<p>
<b>You win the game</b> if your opponent does not control any ships
in their own homeworld at the end of either player's turn.
</p>
<p>
<b>You lose the game</b> if you do not control any ships
in your own homeworld at the end of either player's turn.
</p>
<p>
<b>The game is a draw</b> if, at the end of either player's turn,
neither player controls any ships in their own homeworld.
</p>

<h2>
Setup
</h2>
<p>
Sort the pieces by size and color and place them to the side of the play area.
This is the bank.
If you have the little bank board that comes with the Pyramid Quartet set,
the pieces can be stacked on the board.
</p>
<p>
It's helpful if the players are facing each other across the playing surface.
</p>
<p>
Select a player to go first.
You may want to let the less-experienced player go first
since this often gives a slight advantage.
</p>

<h2>
First turn: establish a homeworld
</h2>
<p>
Each player's first turn is for creating their homeworld.
Your homeworld system will have two stars and one ship.
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Select any two pieces from the bank to be the stars of your homeworld.
    Place them standing up near you in the play area.
    <li> Select any one piece from the bank to be your first ship.
    Place it near your stars pointing away from you.
</ol>

<h2>
Turn options
</h2>

<p>
After you create your homeworld,
you have three options on every turn.
These options are explained in more detail in the next sections.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> <b>Basic action</b>:
    Chose one of your ships and empower it with any technology (color)
    that is available in the same system.
    <li> <b>Sacrifice</b>:
    Choose one of your ships and return it to the bank.
    Then choose one or more of your ships and empower them
    with the technology of the sacrificed ship.
    The number of other ships you can empower
    is the number of pips on the sacrificed ship.
    <li> <b>Pass</b>: Take no action.
</ul>

<p>
The technologies of the colors are explained later.
</p>

<p>
In addition to taking these normal turn actions,
you may trigger a catastrophe if there is an overpopulation anywhere.
Catastrophes are explained later.
</p>

<h3>
Basic action
</h3>

<p>
When you take a basic action,
you choose one ship and empower it with any technology
that is available to you in the same system.
A ship can use
</p>
<ul>
    <li> The technology of any friendly ship in the same system, including itself.
    <li> The technology of any star in the same system.
</ul>

<p>
Example: if you own a blue and a green ship at a system with a yellow star,
<i>either</i> of those ships can use the blue, green, or yellow technology.
</p>

<h3>
Sacrifice
</h3>

<p>
When you choose to sacrifice a ship, you get a multi-step turn.
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Choose one of your ships to sacrifice and return it to the bank.
    <ul>
        <li> You now have access to one or more "sacrifice actions."
        <li> The number of sacrifice actions is the number of pips on the sacrificed ship:
    </ul>
    <li> One at a time, spend each sacrifice action to empower any one of your other ships
    with the technology of the color of the sacrificed ship.
    There is no restriction on which of your ships can be empowered by sacrifice actions.
    <ul>
        <li> Unlike with basic actions,
        the empowered ship does not need a piece of that technology's color in its system.
        <li> The empowered ships do not need to be in the same system as the sacrificed ship.
        <li> One ship can be empowered more than once,
        or each sacrifice action can be used on a different ship.
    </ul>
</ol>

<p>
When a ship is sacrificed,
it may have been the last ship in its system.
If so, the system is immediately forgotten (unless it is a homeworld)
and its star is returned to the bank.
</p>

<p>
You are never required to use all of your available sacrifice actions.
</p>

<h3>
Pass
</h3>

<p>
To pass your turn is to do nothing but let your opponent take another turn.
If passing is your best option, you are probably about to lose.
</p>

<h2>
Technologies
</h2>

<p>
Each color corresponds to a technology, or an ability that a ship can use.
You can empower a ship with a technology either with a basic action
or with a sacrifice action.
</p>

<h3>
Red: capture
</h3>

<p>
A ship empowered with red technology
captures any enemy ship in the same system
as long as the enemy ship is <i>the same size or smaller</i>.
The enemy ship is now controlled by the capturing player.
Turn the enemy ship around to face the direction of its new owner.
</p>

<h3>
Yellow: move
</h3>

<p>
A ship empowered with yellow technology
moves to any system that is connected to its current system.
The destination system can be a newly discovered system with a star taken from the bank.
</p>

<p>
When a ship moves to another system,
move the piece to be near the other pieces in the new system.
If the ship was the last ship in its origin system,
the origin system is immediately forgotten (unless it is a homeworld)
and its star is returned to the bank.
</p>

<h4>
System connectivity
</h4>

<p>
Two systems are connected if they do <i>not</i> have any star sizes in common.
If a system has two stars of different sizes,
then it is <i>not</i> connected to systems that contain stars
of <i>either</i> of those sizes.
</p>

<h4>
Discovery
</h4>

<p>
Rather than moving to an existing system,
a moving ship can discover a new system.
To discover a system, take a piece of any color out of the bank to use as a star.
The size of the star piece must connect the new system
to the origin system of the ship.
Stand the new star upright in a clear space of the play area
and place the moving ship near it.
</p>

<h3>
Green: build
</h3>

<p>
A ship empowered with green technology
produces another ship of its own color.
The built ship is <i>not</i> a green unless the empowered ship is green.
</p>

<p>
When you build a ship,
you must build the <i>smallest</i> available piece of the appropriate color.
Take that piece from the bank
and place it pointing away from you in the same system as the empowered ship.
</p>

<p>
Example: you empower a blue ship with green technology.
There is a small blue piece in the bank, so you build a small blue ship
by taking it from the bank and placing it next to your empowered blue ship.
</p>

<h3>
Blue: trade
</h3>

<p>
A ship empowered with blue technology
is traded with a piece of the <i>same size</i> from the bank.
Place the old ship in the bank,
take the new piece out of the bank,
and place it as your ship in the system where the old ship was.
</p>

<h2>
Overpopulation and catastrophe
</h2>

<p>
When four or more pieces of the same color are in the same system,
they are "overpopulated."
As a free action on your turn, you may trigger a catastrophe against any overpopulated pieces.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> You may trigger a catastrophe
    even if you do not control any ships in that system.
    <li> You may trigger a catastrophe at any point during your turn:
    before you start your normal turn,
    after you finish your normal turn, or between sacrifice actions.
</ul>
<p>
In a catastrophe, all pieces of the overpopulated color are returned to the bank.
Ships and stars both count toward overpopulation,
and all ships and stars of the overpopulated color are destroyed
if the catastrophe is triggered.
</p>

<p>
If the catastrophe causes there to be no stars in a system,
any remaining ships are immediately returned to the bank.
</p>

<p>
If the catastrophe causes there to be no ships in a system,
the system is immediately forgotten (unless it is a homeworld)
and its star is returned to the bank..
