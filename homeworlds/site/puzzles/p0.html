<span style="background-color:yellow">This puzzle is difficult to solve in your head.</span>
So that you don't lose track of how many pieces of each kind are in the bank,
I suggest using physical pieces to help you visualize the game.
</p>
<p>
This is a teaching exercise for giving new players some hands-on experience
after they've just learned the rules.
It gets a new player accustomed to the color powers
and how to move the pieces around.
</p>
<p>
New players can try to win from the position below while assuming that their opponent will never do anything,
but if an experienced player is available,
it may be better to treat like a real game:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The new player takes the role of player Alpha (on the left).
<li> The more experienced player is Beta (on the right).
<li> If left alone, Beta doesn't have any good moves
(they can only pass or commit suicide by abandoning their home),
so Alpha can take their time building up a fleet big enough to win.
<li> If Alpha attempts a badly-planned invasion,
Beta may get to capture a ship and even start building a fleet.
The experienced player may want to give an instructive warning,
as in, "If you do that, I'll be able to capture your ship.
Then I'll move it to another system on my next move and start trying to build up."
</ul>
<p>
As a challenge to more advanced players,
how does Alpha win as quickly as possible?
