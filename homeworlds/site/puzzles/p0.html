This is a teaching exercise for giving new players some hands-on experience
after they've just heard or read the rules.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The new player takes the role of player Alpha (on the left).
<li> The more experienced player is Beta (on the right).
<li> If left alone, Beta doesn't have any good moves
(they can only pass or commit suicide by abandoning their home).
So Alpha can take their time building up a fleet big enough to win,
which is a chance to practice using the color powers.
<li> If Alpha attempts a badly-planned invasion,
Beta may get to capture a ship and even start building a fleet.
The experienced player may want to give an instructive warning instead,
as in, "If you do that, I'll be able to capture your ship.
Then I'll move it to another system on my next move and start trying to build up."
</ul>
For an extra challenge,
what is the fastest route to victory for Alpha?

Alpha can win in 7 moves, which I believe is the fastest possible.

I suppose it's possible that this position has occurred in a real game,
but I composed it as an exercise.
