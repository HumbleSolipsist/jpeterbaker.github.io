<div id="solution">
<p>
In a previous version of this page, I posted poor solution:
"move y2 Altair Alpha."
Alpha has a reasonably good defense against this with "sacrifice y2 Alpha; move y3 Betelgeuse Alpha; move y1 Alpha Castor."
Beta may still be able to win from here, but it's likely to be messy.
</p>
<p>
Beta wins quickly after
<div id="moves">
1... sacrifice y2 Altair<br>
move r3 Beta Altair<br>
move r3 Altair Alpha
</div>
</p>
<p>
It's a great exercise to look at all of Alpha's possible responses and how the game would play out.
I'm not going to lay it all out here at the moment
(maybe if I get time later).
</p>
<p>
This position is from a ladder game on SDG where
Beta was challenging Alpha for position #1.
At this point in the game, Beta played
<div id="moves">
1... discover r1 Beta y3 Deneb<br>
</div>
</p>
<p>
and probably intended to continue with
<div id="moves">
2... sacrifice y2 Altair<br>
move r2 Altair Alpha<br>
move r2 Altair Alpha
</div>
<div id="moves">
3... move r1 Deneb Alpha<br>
catastrophe Alpha r
</div>
<p>
but Alpha responded with
<div id="moves">
2. sacrifice y2 Betelgeuse<br>
move r1 Betelgeuse Altair<br>
move r2 Castor Altair<br>
catastrophe Altair r
</div>
</p>
<p>
Alpha went on to win.
</p>
</div>

<!---
Both players have firepower but weak economies. West has a dominating material advantage, but with only one home star, East may be able to finish the game quickly.

West can repel any immediate invasion of their home. For examples,

...move y2 Altair Alpha
sacrifice y1 Alpha, move y3 Betelgeuse Alpha

OR

...move r2 Altair Alpha
attack r2 Alpha
...move r2 Altair Alpha
sacrifice r2 Alpha, attack r2 Alpha

OR

...sacrifice y2 Altair, move r3 Beta Altair, move r3 Altair Alpha
