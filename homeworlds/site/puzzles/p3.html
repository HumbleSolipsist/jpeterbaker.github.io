<h1>
This analysis is incorrect
</h1>
I goofed on this one. Alpha can respond by sacrificing a yellow at home and reinforce with a y3.
There's no danger of yellow or red catastrophe.
<h1>
The incorrect analysis until I come up with something better
</h1>
<div id="moves">
move y2 Altair Alpha
</div>
<p>
After this move, Alpha must reinforce their home or lose by sacrifice-and-capture,
but moving moving a yellow ship to their home causes an overpopulation,
and moving a red to their home allows Beta to trigger a catastrophe with Alpha's red star.
</p>
<p>
This position is from a ladder game on SDG.
Beta was challenging Alpha for position #1.
Rather than the winning move, Beta chose to play
</p>
<div id="moves">
discover r1 Beta y3 Deneb
</div>
<p>
Alpha's homeworld originally included a large star,
and Beta probably didn't notice the new connection between Alpha and Altair.
Alpha went on to win.
