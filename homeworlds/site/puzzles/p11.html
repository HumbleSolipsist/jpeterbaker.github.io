<p>
West has exactly one choice that will
prevent East from winning on the next turn.
<br>
East should win about 4 turns later.

West's best turn is

<h4>West will lose immediately with any other turn</h4>
<p>
If West does not catastrophe the reds in East's home,
East will win on their turn by moving g3 to West's home and calling catastrophe.
The red catastrophe can only be achieved with the yellow sacrifice that starts
turn 1 above.
</p>
<p>
If West uses the second movement action
for anything except discovering a g2 system,
then a g2 piece will be in the bank for East's turn.
East simply builds g2 in West's home and calls catastrophe.
</p>
<h4>
East then has two winning continuations
</h4>

    </div>
    <p>
    West does not have time to launch an attack
    and must prepare for a direct assault.
    West has two turns in which to obtain a large ship at home and a red ship.
    If west gets the large ship first...

    West must build green to keep it out of the bank and prevent catastrophe.

            build r1 2
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
    Now, West must defend their home from direct assault,
    but there is no time to get a large ship to their home
    and simultaneously obtain a red ship before East's large red arrives.
</div>
</p>
<h4>East should green-teleport the g2</h4>
<p>
After 1., All of East's moves can be considered individually.
</p>
<p>
East could settle for a draw
by moving (or green-teleporting) g3 to West's home for a catastrophe.
But East would prefer to make the game a little longer and win.
</p>
<p>
Green-teleporting the g1 to sytem 2 is a promising move,
but as will be seen, green-teleporting the g2 is much stronger.
</p>
<p>
Trading g3 for some other color allows West to build the g3,
leaving East without any chance of threatening a green catastrophe.

This game was played between capi3101 (West) and Stevie Sasquatchie (East)
as part of <a href='../tournament/links2021winter.html'><!--
-->Homeworlds Live Winter League 2021</a>.
It is <a href='https://homeworlds-live2.glitch.me/archive/view/86'><!--
-->game 86 on HWL</a>.
The game ended in a loss for capi3101,
who must have resigned or run out of time without noticing the possible draw.
</p>
<p>
Bruno Curfs noticed this interesting position
and suggested it to me as a puzzle.
