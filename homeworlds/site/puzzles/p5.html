I believe Beta wins in 6 turns, but I'm still checking.

Beta doesn't quite have enough material for a 2b/3y Doomsday machine.
After demolishing the blue star, they are planning to move their y3 to Alpha's home.
But this move only poses a catastrophe threat, not a direct assault threat.
Beta needs more red.
I think Beta will win if they simply trade b2 for r2 in Beta on their first turn and then proceed with using the Doomsday machine.
Alpha's attempts at counterattack include
    destroying Beta's green star
    (which has the side effect of forcing Beta to sacrifice their r2).
