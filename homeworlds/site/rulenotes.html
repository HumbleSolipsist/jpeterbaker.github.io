My thoughts
</h2>

<h3>
Self-elimination
</h3>
<p>
In chess, I think that the rule against putting yourself in check
is a safeguard against losing accidentally.
Without this rule, people would overlook self-checks
and be forced to lose by those people who say,
"You took your finger off the piece, so that has to be your move.
I capture your king and win! Nyah nyah!"
The no-self-check rule prevents that situation by saying,
"No, you can't force your opponent to commit to the suicidal move
because it's not even legal."
</p>
<p>
In Homeworlds, there's definitely no rule against moving into "check"
(setting up your opponent to destroy you on their turn).
Compared to chess, it's much harder to identify the check condition,
and watching for check is part of the challenge.
But unlike chess
—where capturing your king is something that only your opponent can do—
your own turn action can destroy you in Homeworlds.
</p>
<p>
I don't see any need for homeworld abandonment to be illegal.
Except for beginners, I expect that it would be rare that someone
would accidentally attempt a move that abandons their homeworld.
I take it for granted that players are allowed to resign from games,
so if they want to make one last move as they resign, I don't see why not.
Additionally, if homeworld abandonment is always allowed,
then abandoning the homeworld at the same time that you eliminate your opponent
doesn't need to be treated as a special case.
</p>
<p>
But if a player does abandon their homeworld,
I think that they should have to confirm
that they are deliberately ending the game.
For one thing, requiring confirmation protects beginners from pedants.
Also, in any form of computer-based Homeworlds,
accidental self-elimination might be as easy as a tiny slip of the finger,
so requiring confirmation could protect clumsy experts too.
<h3>
Eliminating opponent and self in the same move
</h3>
<p>
The latest official rules and the community have accepted that
simultaneous elimination is legal and triggers a draw.
I was reluctant to accept this rule for a while, but it's grown on me.
</p>
<h3>
Position loops
</h3>
<p>
The FAQ page—and common sense—dictate that a game is drawn if
a position is repeated several times
and the players agree to end the game with no winner.
However, this is not a very precise rule.
I suggest that, like in chess, a threefold repetition of the exact same position
should be sufficient for either player to unilaterally declare the game drawn.
If somehow the position loop involes discovering a new system,
then the system names should not be considered when determining whether
two positions are identical
(if the systems are being given names at all).
</p>
<h3>
Blue sacrifice swap
</h3>
<p>
Here's what I'm talking about: a player sacrifices a blue ship (at least medium)
and uses the two trade actions to swap the colors
of two of their same-sized ships
(e.g. a r2 ship becomes g2 and a g2 ship becomes r2).
This is obviously legal if a copy of at least one
of involved pieces (say the g2) is in the bank.
In this case the color changes can happen one at a time:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li> The sacrificed blue ship is put into the bank.
<li> The r2 ship is put into the bank.
<li> The g2 piece comes out of the bank and becomes a ship, replacing the r2
(completing one normal blue action).
<li> The g2 ship (not the one just created) is put into the bank.
<li> The r2 piece comes out of the bank and becomes a ship, replacing the g2
(completing a second normal blue action).
</ol>
</p>
<p>
I think it's somewhat reasonable to reorder the operations in a way that
doesn't require any pieces to be in the bank at the beginning of the turn:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li> The sacrificed blue ship is put into the bank.
<li> The r2 ship is put into the bank.
<li> The g2 ship is put into the bank.
<li> The r2 piece comes out of the bank and becomes a ship, replacing the g2.
<li> The g2 piece comes out of the bank and becomes a ship, replacing the r2.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
All versions of the rules agree that a blue action consists
of "swapping" a ship with a piece from the bank,
so it's pretty clear that the rule writers don't intend for this reordered move to be legal.
</p>
<p>
However, this is my website, and since I think it would be kind of cool to allow this move,
I'm going to stretch and call it a grey area &#x1F601.
