<h2>
Definitions found in official rules (any version)
</h2>
<ul>
<li> <u>Demolition fleet</u><br>
    Your opponent has only one large ship at home along
    with another piece of that color.
    Sacrifice a y3 to move two ships of that color to their home,
    call catastrophe, and move in a large ship.
    You are likely to win if you have a red to sacrifice somewhere.

<li> <u>Blurbird mistakes</u><br>
    Allowing your entire home fleet to be destroyed in a single catastrophe.
    <ul>
    <li> <u>Sitting duck</u><br>
    You have nothing but three ships of the same color in your home.
    Your opponent destroys you by moving in the fourth.
    <li> <u>Easy Bluebird</u><br>
    You have nothing but two ships of the same color in your home.
    Your opponent destroys you by sacrificing a y2 to move in two more ships of that color
    (each from 1 move away).
    <li> <u>Tricky Bluebird</u><br>
    You have nothing but two ships of the same color in your home.
    Your opponent destroys you by sacrificing a y3 to move in two more ships of that color
    (one from 1 move away and another from 2 moves away).
    </ul>

<li> <u>Investment</u><br>
    Occupying a larger-marker system with a green ship
    with the intention of eventually sacrificing the green piece
    and immediately building the large marker as a ship.

<li> <u>Doomsday machine</u><br>
    Any ship at home, two large yellows, and six other ships:
    three each of your opponent's star colors,
    with the six ships one jump from your opponent's home.
    You can win in two moves by sacrificing the yellows
    and moving all the six ships to their home for catastrophes.

<li> <u>Factory</u><br>
    A large green ship and at least one other green ship
    when there are no greens left in the bank.
    The g3  may be sacrificed and rebuilt
    effectively allowing two build actions per turn.

<li> <u>Green teleport</u><br>
    Sacrificing a green to rebuild it in another system.

<li> <u>Happy system</u><br>
    A system with exactly one piece of each color.

<li> <u>Keep-away</u><br>
    Discovering a star rather than letting your opponent build the marker piece as a ship.

<li> <u>Primary directive</u><br>
    Defend the homeworld with these principles:
    <ul>
        <li> Keep a large ship in your homeworld.
        <li> Get a red when your opponent does.
        <li> Diversify and minimize your home fleet.
        <li> Once one star is destroyed, monopolize the other color.
    </ul>

<li> <u>Squonking</u><br>
    Sacrificing a ship to prevent its capture.<br>
    Andy also uses the term for trading a ship to block larger builds,
    see <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGbIxb9lFds&t=1450s'>this Homeworlds Theater</a>.

<li> <u>Terraforming</u><br>
    Sacrificing a yellow ship and discovering the piece as a star in the same move.

<li> <u>Planetary defense system</u><br>
    A red star in a home system.

<li> Universe sizes
<ul>
    <li> <u>Large universe</u><br>
        Game where initial homeworlds are three moves away.
    <li> <u>Small universe</u><br>
        Game where initial homeworlds are two moves away.
    <li> <u>Microverse</u><br>
        Game where initial homeworlds are one move away (connected).
</ul>

<li> <u>Hyperspace bypass</u><br>
    The change in system connectivity that occurs
    when on marker is destroyed in a home system.

<li> Homeworld marker combinations
<ul>
    <li> <u>Banker</u><br>
        A small and a medium marker
        (good for setting up investments).
    <li> <u>Fortress</u><br>
        A medium and a large marker
        (difficult to invade after most of the small pieces become ships).
    <li> <u>Goldilocks</u><br>
        A small and a large marker
        (comfortably between the banker and fortress).
    <li> <u>Gemini star</u><br>
        Two markers of the same size.
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>
Terms that people don't use yet, but they totally should
</h2>
<ul>
<li>If I control a system in a large-universe game, then that system may be my
    <ul>
    <li> <u>Colony</u><br>
        if it is connected to my home and not my opponent's.
    <li> <u>Outpost</u><br>
        if it is connected to my opponent's home and not my own.
    <li> <u>Island</u><br>
        if it is connected to neither home.
    </ul>

<li> <u>Local economy</u><br>
    The collection of colors at a particular system.
    For example, if you move/trade away your last red ship in a system, you have lost the local red economy.

<li> <u>Andy's home</u><br>
    The homeworld setup b2 r1 g3 (<a href='http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Andy/Games/ILoveHomeworlds.html#Opening'>Andy's standard start</a>).

<li> <u>Instafreeze</u><br>
   The fastest possible economic freeze, <a href='tactics.html#instafreeze'>explained here</a>.
<li> <u>Doomsweek machine</u><br>
    Like a doomsday machine but slow-acting, <a href='tactics.html#doomsweek'>explained here</a>.
<li> <u>Deterrent principle</u><br>
     A red anywhere is a red everywhere, <a href='strategyGuide.html#deterrent'>explained here</a>.
<li> <u>Concentration</u><br>
    The number of pieces of the same color in a system.
    Decreasing concentration in your systems is typically good.
<li> <u>Primary directive</u><br>
    Keep a large ship at home.
    Contrary to the Pyramid Arcade rules,
    I think this principle is so important
    that it alone should be called the Primary Directive.
<li> <u>Material</u><br>
    The amount of ship power a player has.
    A player has a material advantage if they have more ships or larger ships.
    Very roughly, material can be measured
    as the total pip count of a player's ships.
    I myself usually use this modified material score:
        <ul>
        <li> each small ship = 1
        <li> each medium ship = 3
        <li> first large ship = 12
        <li> second large ship = 9
        <li> each additional large ship = 7
        </ul>
<li> <u>Spite</u><br>
    Sacrificing a red to capture a red in the same system
    when opponent is attempting a red catastrophe.
<li> <u>Dirty factory</u><br>
    Sacrificing a g3 to quickly build the three ships of another color
    including at least one large.
    This can be used to quickly lock your opponent out of that color,
    or get an additional large ship without giving your opponent the chance
    to get it first as they would if you built one ship at a time.
<li> <u>Milking the cow</u><br>
    Repeatedly building and trading a large ship
    of a color that you have monopolized.
</ul>
