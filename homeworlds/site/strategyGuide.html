<h3>
The most important questions
</h3>

<ul>
<li>"If I did nothing this turn, what would my opponent's best move be?"
<li>"If I make this move that I am considering, what will my opponent's best move be?"
</ul>

<h3>
After your opponent moves
</h3>
<p>
Identify what objective(s) they were trying to accomplish.
<ul>
<li> Was it a "victory?" Did they just get what they wanted?
<li> Or was it a "setup?" Is it just one step toward something that they want?
    <ul>
    <li> If it is a setup, can you spoil it?
    <li> Or can you get a head start on reacting to their plan's success?
    <li> Or is it safe to work on a plan of your own while they build toward their goal?
    </ul>
<li> Or was it a retreat? Were they just reacting to your last move?
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Moves can be multi-purpose.
Even after you see one purpose to your opponent's move,
check for others.
</p>
<h3>
Will your move leave a desirable piece available for your opponent to build?
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are you building the last ship of that size?
<li>Are you discovering a system marker with the last pieces of that size?
<li>If your opponent has a medium or large green, can they sacrifice it to skip past a size in the bank?
(see the <a href='glossary.html#dirtyFactory'>Dirty Factory</a> move).
<li>Are you abandoning a system? Will they want the marker as a ship?
<li>Are you trading a ship? Will they build the old piece?
<li>Are you sacrificing a ship? Will they build it?
<li>Are you causing a catastrophe? Will they want the pieces?
</ul>

<h3>
Specific things that are tiresome to constantly consider but neglect will cost you games
</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Identify <u>every</u> catastrophe your opponent could possibly cause.
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow sacrifices provide extreme mobility. Check twice.
    </ul>
    <li>What if your opponent attempted an all-in homeworld attack right now?
    <ul>
        <li>If they were to start moving all their ships into your home as quickly as possible, what would happen?
        <li>Could you attack the ships as quickly as they arrived?
        <li>Could there be a catastrophe that you wouldn't have time to prevent?
        <li>If their attack would just barely fail, what more do they need to make it succeed?
    </ul>
    <li>What if YOU were to attempt an all-in homeworld attack right now?
    <ul>
        <li>What more do you need to make it succeed?
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name='deterrent'/>A red anywhere is a red everywhere
</h3>
<p>
One of the strategic tips in any Homeworlds strategy guide is,
"When your opponent gets red, get red yourself."
This is good advice.
It often doesn't even matter much where the red ships are.
If your opponent has a red ship anywhere,
you need to get one anywhere that you can.
</p>
<p>
A single red ship can simultaneously deter invasions at all of your systems.
Regardless of which system your opponent chooses to invade,
you can sacrifice the red ship and capture the invading ship.
Consequently, your opponent may choose not to attempt any invasions.
I call this the "deterrent principle."
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if your opponent lacks red, your red ship can be used to power an invasion
of <i>any</i> of their systems.
</p>

<h4>
...but a red ship can only be sacrificed once
</h4>
<p>
A single red ship can deter attacks for quite a while,
but remember that a single red ship can only be sacrificed once.
If your opponent launches an invasion that forces you to sacrifice your only red ship,
then you don't have a red ship anymore.
You may now be vulnerable to a second invasion
where your opponent has red ships to sacrifice but you do not.
If that invasion is at your homeworld, you're likely to lose the game.
</p>

<h3>
Always call catastrophe
</h3>
<p>
In a two player game, if your turn is going to end with an overpopulation on the board,
you should always trigger the catastrophe, even if it's a bad catastrophe for you.
<ul>
<li> If it's a catastrophe that's good for you, then obviously you should trigger it.
<li> If it's a catastrophe that's bad for you, then your opponent will just trigger it on their turn.
What's more, if you let them trigger it, they might find a way to get some advantage out of
triggering the catastrophe <u>after</u> they perform some other action
(like building a large ship that will be unavailable after the catastrophe).
So it is no worse and possibly better for you to trigger it yourself.
</ul>
</p>
<h4>
...unless you really want to trust in psychology
</h4>
<p>
So theoretically speaking, you should <i>never</i> leave an overpopulation on the board after your turn.
However, it always <i>feels</i> bad to lose lots of ships to a catastrophe,
and if a catastrophe hurts both players, neither of you may want to trigger it,
even in order to get ahead a little.
</p>
<p>
Consider the case where you are forced to create an overpopulation
that would destroy lots of material for both you and your opponent.
If you think that the catastrophe is only slightly better for your opponent's position,
you might reasonably not trigger it.
You should do this not for strictly logical reasons,
but in the hope that your opponent won't <i>feel</i> losing that much material.
<p>
Another reason to pass up a catastrophe might be against a tired opponent.
Destroying similar amounts of material for both players tends to prolong the game,
so if your opponent is feeling worn down, they may pass up an opportunity to call catastrophe,
if it only scores them a small advantage.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you might want to neglect triggering a catastrophe against a very inexperienced opponent.
New players might not notice the overpopulation;
they might not even know what a catastrophe is.
You could get away with an un-triggered catastrophe due to ignorance.
However, I absolutely do not condone exploiting players who don't know all of the rules.
Make it a teaching moment instead.
(And how have they managed to tangle you into an unwanted overpopulation anyway?)
</p>
<p>
So even though strict game theoretical logic dictates that every overpopulation should become a catastrophe,
some opponents may not trigger catastrophes for reasons outside of logic,
especially if they haven't read this guide.
If your opponent also fails to trigger the catastrophe that you don't want,
they've gifted you get another turn to try to resolve the situation without falling behind.
</p>

<h3>
Material advantage
</h3>
<p>
If you have a material advantage, you should be willing to cause catastrophes or
force mutual sacrifices that trim down both fleets by similar amounts.
A one-ship advantage is a bigger deal when both fleets are small than
when they are large.
</p>
<p>
Contrariwise, when you have a material disadvantage, you should build ships and
not worry too much if your opponent builds the same amount.
A one-ship disadvantage shrinks (proportionately) if both fleets grow at
the same rate.
</p>
<p>
If you have more large ships than your opponent, try to harass their systems
before they have time to get another large ship.
Move that big ship into an enemy system with lots of smaller ships and no big ship defending.
Attack any ships that don't manage to escape.
Be careful of catastrophes, which are often the best defense against larger ships.
</p>
<p>
If you have a large-ship disadvantage, spread your fleet out.
A lone ship that can run away is an unattractive target for an invading large.
Ideally, every ship should be be either
<ul>
<li> In a system with a large defender
<li> Or in a system with no other ships, but with an escape plan
(the ship or star is yellow).
</ul>
</p>

<h3>
Red flags
</h3>

<p>
Here are BAD situations, roughly in order from worst to least-worst.
I need to avoid these things (unless I can make something even worse happen to my opponent).
Contrariwise, it's good if my opponent has one of these problems.
<ol>
<li>I have no ships in my home and I lose the game.
<li>My opponent has more (or bigger) ships in my home system than I can capture in one turn,
even by sacrificing my largest red.
<li>One of my home system markers is destroyed.
<li>I don't have a large ship in my home system.
<li>There is a near-catastrophe (three pieces) involving my ships
(or the marker for a system where I have ships).
<li>My opponent has a red ship (anywhere) and I do not.
<li>My opponent has more large ships than me.
<li>My opponent has more yellow ships than me.
<li>My opponent has a ship in the same system as me and it's bigger than my ships there.
<li>The ship(s) in my home system are all the same color
(the <a href='glossary.html#bluebird'/>Bluebird</a> mistake).
<li>My only large ship in my home system is the same color as one (or more!) ships or markers in my home
(my opponent might get a <a href='glossary.html#demolitionFleet'>Demolition Fleet</a>).
</ol>
</p>

<h3>
Other thoughts
</h3>

<p>
Homeworlds is a game where it's easy to charge ahead with your own plans
while ignoring what your opponent is up to until it's too late.
That's why these tips focus on making sure you
look at what your opponent is working on.
Choosing a goal and taking little steps toward it is easy.
Figuring out your opponent's plans takes work.
