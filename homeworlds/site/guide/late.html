</h2>
<p>
Inevitable doom can last more than a day.
</p>
<p>
Destroying a homeworld by star demolition requires two catastrophes,
and the defender will try to prevent each of them.
The most obvious way to circumvent any possible defense is to create each overpopulation all in one turn.
The all-at-once technique is achieved with the
<a href='glossary.html#doomsday_machine'>traditional Doomsday machine</a>.
</p>
<p>
Traditional two-turn Doomsday machines are difficult to make.
In particular, you must be able to sacrifice two large yellows ships.
There are only three large yellow pieces in the game,
and if two of them are controlled by the enemy (either as ships or stars),
a traditional Doomsday machine may be impossible.
</p>
<p>
However, there are Doomsday machines with lower material requirements.
They simply require extra turns to operate.
Doomsday machines usually destroy the two stars in two separate phases:
bring in ships to destroy one star, then bring in ships to destroy the second star.
(It's an interesting challenge to find a position where
the phases must overlap in order to succeed,
in other words, where a ship of the second stars color must be sent to the enemy home
before the first star is destroyed.)
</p>
<p>
Each phase can take 1-3 turns to complete.
If each phase can be completed in one turn,
then it's a traditional Doomsday machine.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> A two-turn Doomsday phase gets three star-colored ships to your opponent's home in just two turns.
        Obviously, you'll need to sacrifice a y2 or y3 to get two ships there at once.
        Either before or after the double arrival,
        you can move a single star-colored ship with with a basic action.
        Whether or not your opponent attacks the first ship(s) to arrive,
        the ship(s) you add on the second turn of the phase complete the overpopulation.
    <li> A three-turn Doomsday phase doesn't require any yellow sacrifice at all.
        You just move the three star-colored ships one at a time.
        However, the <u>second</u> ship must be large
        (or as big as the biggest defender)
        and you must have access to enough red to be able to take control of your opponent's home
        if they ignore the invading large for one turn.
        <br>
        Here's how it works:
        <br>
        Your opponent will normally attack the first ship that arrives.
        Once you move in with a second star-colored ship,
        your opponent can sacrifice, move, or trade the first ship
        in order to reduce the concentration of the star's color.
        <u>But</u>, if your second invading ship is large
        (and you have enough red power),
        then they must respond by attacking it.
        The third ship (of any size) can then move in for the catastrophe.
        <br>
        <a href='#no_slow_red_cat'>This section</a>
        discusses in detail the fact that, if the star is red,
        sacrificing the red ship that they just captured from you and attacking your large ship
        can be done in one move,
        which defends against both the star demolition and direct assault threats.
</ul>
<p>
If your opponent didn't notice your Doomsday machine as it was being constructed,
they will probably see it once you move ship(s) to their home.
They will look for ways to interrupt your machine's execution.
Make sure that there's nothing they can do between your turns that will interfere.
</p>
<p>
I'll emphasize that, in a three-turn Doomsday phase,
the second move needs to be a double threat:
if your opponent attacks your large ship, you can move in the last ship for the catastrophe
(just like you planned).
But if they instead use that turn to reduce the concentration of that color
(by sacrificing, moving, or trading the captured invader),
then you need to be prepared to switch your game plan to winning by
<a href="glossary.html#direct_assault">direct assault</a>.
This direct assault has a one-turn head start since
your opponent spent a turn responding to the catastrophe threat.
You need to carefully compare your red power with that of your enemy to determine
who wins the fight if you begin trying to capture all of their home ships.
</p>
<p>
In the image below, Beta has assembled a Doomsday machine with two three-turn phases.
In the <a href='glossary.html#doom_notation'>notation I use in the glossary</a>,
this is a 3g/3y Doomsday machine.
Notice that it would not work as a 3y/3g machine
(overpopulating yellow first then green)
since the yellow ships are needed for the greens to advance.

<p>
In the particular scenario above, Alpha must attack on moves 2 and 5
because otherwise Beta may achieve the catastrophes
by sacrificing g3.
In many scenarios, the defender may simply ignore the small invading ships and use the turn productively.
Sometimes, they may use that turn to launch a counterattack,
either on the Doomsday machine or on the attacker's homeworld.
Before you engage your slow Doomsday machine, make sure your opponent can't use the spare time to ruin your plan.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the three-turn Doomsday phases does not usually work on red stars
(<a href='#no_slow_red_cat'>see here</a>).
</p>
<h3>
<a name='no_slow_red_cat'/>No slow red catastrophe
</h3>
<font size='1'>[<a href='#no_slow_red_cat'>link</a>]</font><br>
<p>
Your opponent can't usually cause a red catastrophe against you by moving red ships one at a time.
If they attempt this, here's what should happen
</p>
<ol>
<li> They move a red ship into your system.
<li> You attack the first red ship.
<li> They move another red ship into your system.
<li> You sacrifice the first red ship to attack the second red ship.
<li> They see the error of their ways.
</ol>
<p>
For example, in the position below, Beta has just blundered
by moving r3 into Alpha's home.
Alpha should sacrifice the r1 and attack the invader.
Beta has regrets.
</p>
<center>
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/SfK41v1.png'>
</center>
<p>
You should check your own situation carefully, however.
You must have a ship large enough to attack any invading reds,
and—if you are defending a red system marker—
you shouldn't let your only large ship be a red one.
If your only large ship is red as well as a system marker,
then you won't be able to sacrifice the r3 to attack an invading r3,
so a slow red catastrophe can happen when your opponent
moves in with their second red ship.

<h2>
<a name='invasion'>Textbook direct assault
</h2>
<font size='1'>[<a href='#invasion'>link</a>]</font><br>
<p>
Of the three <a href="glossary.html#victory_paths">paths to victory</a>,
the direct assault seems to get the least attention.
Every strategy guide talks about
Doomsday machines (the surest way to achieve star demolition)
and the Bluebird mistake (allowing a game-losing fleet catastrophe).
New players may not have a clear idea of how a direct assault occurs,
so their first exposure is likely to be a defeat they didn't see coming.
</p>
<p>
Typically, every player has a large ship in their homeworld and a red ship someplace (which they could sacrifice).
If your opponent doesn't have a red ship,
they'll probably at least have a <a href="glossary.html#planetary_defense">planetary defense system</a>.
So if you move any ship into your opponent's home, they'll just capture it, right?
</p>
<p>
Not if you invade with several ships at once so that they can't all be captured.
Your opponent's defenses will determine the size of the invasion fleet you need.
Say that
</p>
<ul>
    <li> the number of large ships that your opponent has in their home is L
    <li> your opponent's largest red ship is of size R.
    <ul>
        <li> If they have no red ships but a red homestar,
            it counts as a small red ship, R=1.
        <li> If they have no access to red, R=0.
        <li> If they have a large red in their home <u>and</u>
            that is their only large ship in their home,
            <u>then ignore that ship when finding R</u>
            because that R3 can't be sacrificed for capturing large invaders.
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
If R+L is more than 3, then a <u>basic</u> direct assault won't work.
You could theoretically have a two-wave invasion with more than three ships,
but that's more complicated than I'm going to illustrate here.
</p>
<p>
Here's what you need:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> R+1 large ships poised to move into your opponent's home.
        These are the "invaders."
    <li> A yellow ship of size R+1 (not one of the invaders).
    <li> A red ship of size R+L (not one of the invaders).
</ul>
<p>
Here's the battle plan:
</p>
<ol>
<li> You sacrifice your yellow ship and move your R+1 large ships into your opponent's home
<li> They sacrifice their largest red to attack R of your invading larges (you still have one left)
<li> You sacrifice your red ship to attack the R ships that they just captured
as well as the L large ships that they had to begin with.
</ol>
<p>
You now have two or more large ships in your opponent's home and they have none.
Usually, their only defense at this point (besides a counterattack)
is to catastrophe your larges.
</p>
<p>
Compared to catastrophe-based wins, direct assaults can be difficult to plan.
When you're invading and capturing ships, you need your ships to stay alive
(unlike when you're pushing ships into catastrophes).
Your opponent has time to fight back, so it can get confusing.
You need to examine your own case carefully to figure out how to invade.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

Below are some positions where the player "Beta"
is considering a direct assault on the enemy homeworld.
Below each figure is some analysis
including a table of the expected commands if Beta attempts an invasion.

Beta wins with a basic direct assault.
<ul>
    <li> Alpha's maximum red power is R=1.
    <li> Alpha has L=1 large ship at home.
    <li> Beta can move R+1=2 large ships to Alpha's home at once.
    <li> Alpha is expected to capture R=1 of the invaders.
    <li> Beta can then capture all R+L=2 larges in Alpha's home.

A <u>basic</u> direct assault cannot work because

<ul>
    <li> Alpha has R=3 red power and
    <li> Beta cannot possibly bring R+1=4 ships to Alpha's home in one shot.

So if Beta invades with three, the invaders are simply captured.

However, if Beta moves just two ships to Alpha's home,
Alpha is forced to sacrifice their only red ship,

Yellow can then launch a second stage with R+1=1 large ship and win.

Beta has enough <u>material</u> for a basic direct assault,
but the invasion still fails because the invading ships are both blue
and Alpha can defend with a catastrophe.

If Beta instead starts by trading one of their B3 ships for another color,
a basic direct assault will work.

<p>
A <u>basic</u> direct assault would fail because
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Alpha has L=2 large ships and R=1 red power and
    <li> Beta does not have a red ship of size L+R=3.
</ul>
<p>
However, Beta can still conduct a successful invasion
by attacking Alpha's only red ship
(instead of following the basic direct assault formula
by attacking a large ship).

        <div class="ply">
            2...<br>
            sacrifice r1 Beta<br>
            attack r1 Alpha
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="moveRow">
        <div class="ply">
            3.<br>
            trade g3 r3 Alpha
        </div>
        <div class="ply">
            3...<br>
            attack r3 Alpha
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
Importantly, Alpha did not have any way to get more red once the invasion started.
If Alpha could have built a red ship in their home after Beta invaded,
then Alpha would still have a red ship after Beta captured one.
Then Alpha could capture it back, and the position would repeat endlessly,
ending the game in a draw.

<a name='swift_victory'/>Plan for complete, swift victory

<p>
As the Homeworlds rules say,
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.looneylabs.com/sites/default/files/literature/Homeworlds%20Rules13.pdf">
"One of the easiest ways to lose this game is<br>
to mount an attack that fails to annihilate your<br>
opponent, but leaves your own empire vulnerable.<br>
This most often happens when you knock out half<br>
of a player's Homeworld, leaving you with fewer<br>
ships and your opponent with a better-connected<br>
Homeworld than before. Plan for total victory!"
</blockquote>
<p>
This is good advice, and I'd like to add some details.
The act of destroying one of your opponent's homestars has three destabilizing effects on the game,
each of which can open new opportunities for your opponent to suddenly ruin your plan.
</p>
<h4>
1. You lost ships
</h4>
<p>
Destroying one of your opponent's stars usually costs you at least three ships.
A two turn demolition can be achieved with three small star-colored ships and a y2--if
you're lucky enough to have all three small ships of the star's color.
Otherwise, you'll be destroying two or more of your own mediums and/or at least one large
(more on what ship size combinations can be used to destroy stars <a href="tactics.html#doomsweek">here</a>).
In many games, that much ship destruction is enough to turn the balance of material power in your opponent's favor.
</p>

<h4>
2. Your opponent's homeworld gained connections
</h4>
<p>
After a star's destruction, your opponent's home is connected to systems with stars of the destroyed star's size
(the <a href="glossary.html#hyperspace_bypass">hyperspace bypass</a> principle).
If that star was a size that is in your own home,
your homes are now connected (assuming that the universe was originally large).
Having connected homes may give your opponent a chance to counter-attack.
</p>

<h4>
3. The bank is refreshed
</h4>
<p>
The bank now has the pieces involved in your catastrophe,
the stars of any systems that you abandoned,
and your sacrificed ship (if you used one).
Your opponent may be able to trade or build the pieces that you just returned.
If you were barely containing your opponent's advances before,
then the new ships might be just what they need to get back in the game.
This is especially true if your move returned a y3 piece to the bank.
A new y3 ship might give your opponent the mobility they need to give you trouble.
</p>

<h4>
...so minimize the come-back risk
</h4>
<p>
Destroying a homestar can throw a game into chaos in the ways listed above,
and you should minimize the length of the chaotic period by
destroying the second star as quickly as possible.
If your plan to demolish the second star requires you to build more ships
or to move ships to different systems,
try to perform these preparation moves <u>before</u> destroying the first star.
