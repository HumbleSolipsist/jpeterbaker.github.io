<h2>
What Anywhere Board Games is
</h2>
<p>
<a href='http://anywhereboardgames.com/'>Anywhere Board Games</a> (ABG)
is an open source web app for playing board games online.
The interface is drag-and-drop based with a context menu for special operations,
like rotating a piece or changing (flipping) its state (face).
</p>
<p>
Users can provide .abg files (JSON format) to the server
in order to describe pieces, their positions, and image URLs
of what they pieces should look like in each state.
Pieces of any kind can be added to a game in progress,
and the game state can be saved as a .abg file for future use,
so the game board is also a game creation tool.
</p>
<p>
<u>Users need to run their own servers</u>.
The Windows version of ABG is packed with a launcher for an Apache server
(this is the only version I've tested so far).
Clients can then connect with browsers via IP address
(the default port for the Windows version is 8080).
</p>
<h2>
Playing Homeworlds through ABG
</h2>
<p>
You can download my .abg file for Homeworlds using the link below.
I plan to make several similar versions
of my Homeworlds .abg file to include different features
(turn token, turn timers, colorblind-friendly pieces, etc.).
I will list them here as they are created.
</p>
<p>
You should right click on the link and choose "Save link/target as..."
and then open the file from the game interface while connected to the server.
