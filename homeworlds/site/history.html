<ul>
    <li> (1987)
    Andy Looney writes the short stories "Icehouse" and "The Children of Mars"
    describing a game played with small pyramid pieces.
    <ul>
        <li> Icehouse is described as a game played with little pyramids
        but no turns and no board.
        <li> Andy makes some prototype pieces
        but isn't able to come up with satisfactory rules for an accompanying game.
    </ul>
    <li> (1989)
    John Cooper's rules for Icehouse are handed out to friends of John and the Looneys.
    Icehouse largely matches the description of the fictional game.
    <ul>
        <li> The same year, enthusiasts organize the first International Icehouse Tournament.
        <li> John writes for the fan newsletter <i>Hypothermia</i> under the name Dr. Cool.
    </ul>
    <li> (1996)
    <i>Hypothermia</i> begins publishing rules for other games to play with Icehouse pieces.
    <li> (1996)
    Andy and Kristin Looney establish Looney Labs to publish Andy's card game Fluxx.
    <ul>
        <li> As Andy says in <i>Hypothermia</i> 13 in 1996,
        the Icehouse pyramids were not financially feasible at this time.
        The success of Fluxx gives Looney Labs more freedom to develop the pyramids.
    </ul>
    <li> (1998)
    John Cooper invents the new game "IceTraders" for the Icehouse pieces.
    <ul>
        <li> John said in conversation that IceTraders grew out of a desire to make
        a game about pieces co-equally occupying clusters
        rather than single pieces occupying traditional spaces or squares.
        During development, the working name for IceTraders was "Clusterf***."
    </ul>
    <li> (1999)
    Pieces and rules for IceTraders are distributed as part of
    <i>Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set</i>.
    <li> (2000)
    <i>The Martian Chess Set</i> wins the Origins Award for best abstract board game.
    <li> (2000-2011)
    Tournaments for IceTraders and Homeworlds are included in the Big Experiments at Origins.
    <li> (2001)
    John Cooper modifies the rules of IceTraders, and the result is named "Homeworlds."
    <ul>
        <li>
        Like IceTraders, Homeworlds was designed as a hybrid abstract and 
        social deduction game best for four players.
    </ul>
    <li> (2002)
    The rules of Homeworlds are published for the first time
    in the booklet <i>Playing with Pyramids</i>.
    <li> (2004)
    With Andy's input, John agrees that the two-player experience is improved by
    reducing the bank to three trios of each color.
    The modified game is called "Binary Homeworlds."
    <li> (2004)
    The first Binary Homeworlds tournament is part of Big Experiment #5.
    <li> (2005)
    Aaron Dalton develops the website Super Duper Games (SDG)
    for playing board games by correspondence.
    <ul>
        <li> SDG includes the first online version of Homeworlds.
    </ul>
    <li> (2006-2016) Looney Labs experiments with ways to package and market Icehouse pieces.
    <ul>
        <li> Homeworlds is featured in
        the <i>3House</i> booklet (2007),
        the <i>Pyramid Primer</i> booklet (2012),
        and the <i>Pyramid Arcade</i> set (2016).
    </ul>
    <li> (2015)
    Draws by simultaneous elimination are informally added to the rules of Homeworlds.
    <li> (2015)
    Andy begins awarding physical medals to people who beat him at Homeworlds.
    <li> (2017)
    Babamots begin running The Great Homeworlds Tournament.
    <li> (2020)
    Homeworlds is distributed in a standalone box as a member of the Pyramid Quartet.
    <li> (2020)
    "thelast19digitsofpi" develops the website Homeworlds Live.
    <ul>
        <li> This is the first online version of Homeworlds designed for <i>real-time</i> play.
    </ul>
    <li> (2022)
    The website Board Game Arena publishes a Homeworlds implementation
    supporting both correspondence and live play.
</ul>
