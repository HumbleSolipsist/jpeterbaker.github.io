I might expand this someday into a narrative format,
especially to incorporate a description of changes to the rules.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> (1987)
    Andy Looney writes the short stories "Icehouse" and "The Children of Mars"
    describing a game played with small pyramid pieces.
    <ul>
        <li> Icehouse is described as a game with no turns and no board,
        but no such game exists yet.
        <li> Andy 
    </ul>
    <li> (1989)
    John Cooper's rules for Icehouse are published.
    They largely match the description of the fictional game.
    <ul>
        <li> The same year, enthusiasts play game in the International Icehouse Tournaments.
        <li> Cooper writes for the fan newsletter "Hypothermia" under the name "Dr. Cool."
    </ul>
    <li>
    <li> (1996)
    Hypothermia publishes rules for other games to play with Icehouse pieces.
    <li> (1998)
