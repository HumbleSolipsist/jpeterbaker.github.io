The Great Homeworlds Tournament is an online Tournament for the board game
<a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds">
Binary Homworlds
</a>.

I'm making this small site to more easily present information to players
and keep a record of results.
I'm not exactly a web designer, so expect this ugly style on the other pages too.
